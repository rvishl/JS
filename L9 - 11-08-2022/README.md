# Task:
- I have a string - 
const text = 'I love teaching and empowering people. I teach HTML, CSS, JS, React, Python.'
- Your task is to:
1. Print the word which contains maximum vowels. [Using array method].

2. You just copy pasted the json from here - https://fakestoreapi.com/carts

- To calculate finally a pair (<product>, <count>).
- Part1, calculate the total quantity for product id 1.
- Part2, put it in a function and calculate for all of them.

## Object
- A collection of data.
- It has key value pairs.
- Key can be anything, but in string data type.
- This is a DataType in JS.
- Object are very very very inefficient in looping.
- Key has to be unique.
- If the key is same, it will update.
- The sequence of elements does not matter.

- The Alphabetical order which you see in the console when you expand the object is because of goodness of the browser. The browser is implementing sort for the developers to debug easily.

- Just like arrays, object elements are also separated by comma (,).

- Because keys are assumed to be string, we can remove the quotation mark. (This feature was introduced in ES4 (2012 - 2013), probably).

- The keys are supposed to be strings, if we don't give it, then JS will try to convert.

### Leexicography
Lexicography -> A fancy way of saying alphabetical ordering.
- We use this to write the sequence for dictionary.

### How to Create
- {} syntax
- We use {} to define the object and inside that we write the key value pairs.
- Syntax -> key: value,
- For the last key of my object, we can actually skip the comma. (Recommended).
- It is mandatory to give key value pairs, otherwise, it will be a syntax error.
- If we want to use key from a variable. We put it inside a square bracket.
- Because JS converts (tries to) everything into a string, it will convert that array into a string.
- Value can be anything. Even other objects and even functions.

- Constructor Approach:
- In the constructor, we directly create an object using the new keyword.
- In this approach, we DO NOT pass the value.
- If we do it, it will create an object of that datatype of whatever we pass as argument.

### How to update/add a value.
- We use a dot syntax.
- <object>.<property>
- Example: console -> It is a big object.
- It contains a lot of functions that we can use.

- If in an object, there are multiple elements with same key, the one written later will override all the previous ones.

### delete operator
- IT IS AN OPERATOR.
- This is used to remove any element from the object.
- It's a unary operator.
- It is used to delete any property of an object.
- Usage: delete <object_variable>.<property_name>

## Object Methods
- These are the built in methods of object.
- Some of them can be used directly on the Object variable.
- Others needs to be called using Object. class.

### keys()
- This is on the Object class.
- Usage: Object.keys(<object_variable>)
- This returns an ARRAY of all keys which are part of my object.
- If you want to loop on the object, this can be used as a way to do it.

### values()
- This is also on the object class.
- Usage: Object.values(<object_variable>)
- This returns an ARRAY of all the values which are part of my object.

### Further Reading
- Go and read -> memory management on MDN

## Task:
- We have an object.

- From this object, print the list of names of students who are doing MERN (Mongo, Express, React Node).
- Print the list of students who have scored 40 or more marks.
