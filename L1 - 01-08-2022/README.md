## What is JavaScript?

- JavaScript is a Asynchronous Single-Threaded Dynamic Interperted Programming Language.
- JS is a single-threaded asynchronous scripting language.
- Single Threaded - At max, JS will execute only 1 task at a time.
- Asynchronous - The ability of JS to execute the functions/instructions out of their sequence.
- Loosely Typed (Dynamic) - Data-type is not a restriction in JS.
- Interpreted / Scripting - The conversion of the code and execution happens line by line. As compared to compilation where the whole code is converted first and then executed.
- It is case sensitive.
- fn() is not same as writing FN();

## Programming Paradigms:

- A programming paradigm is the way in which the code.
- for example:

  - Do we make classes for everything? - OOP
  - Do we make functions for everything? - functional progrtamming.
  - Do we write them in separate modules? - Modular Programming Paradigm.

- JS is multi-paradigm. -> You as a developer is free to choose the approach you want.

## How do you add JS into your code?

- 3 approaches, external, internal and inline.

## Internal Approach
- We are adding the script tag internally in the HTML file.
- <script></script>

## Inline Approach
- This is done by adding the JS in line of the HTML element itsself.

## External Approach
- Here, the JS code is completely separated into a different JS file and is added at the last.
- Good because it keeps the code clean.


## Developer Console | Developer Tools
- F12
- Shift + Ctrl + I / Shift + Cmd + U
- Right Click > Inspect
- Menu > More > Developer Tools

## Comments
- In HTML <!-- -->
- In JS
  - Single Line -> //Statement.....
  - Multiple Lines -> /* Statement......*/

## Attribute (Concept of HTML)
- We write this in the opening tag.
- They provide additional looks and functionalities to the element. 


## Why index.html
- This is the first file that the browser will look for.
- If the file name is index.html, we don't need to put it in the URL.
- If the file name isn NOT index.html, then we need to write that filename in the URL.

## Variables
- VAriables are like containers which store some data.
- They can update the data.
- let is block scoped.
- Because JS is loosely typed, we can create a variable with 1 data type and update it with another.
- Usage: const <name>

### Constant
- These are the containers which we create but then we cannot update.
- const is also block scoped.
- Usage: const <name>

### Datatype
- Datatype is type of data. For Example:

1. String - A collection of characters, wrapped between " or '.
2. Number - A number, 1, 2, 3, 4, -50, 44.35.
3. BigInt - Very very large numbers. Upto 2^53
4. Boolean - true / false;
5. Object - It's a collection of keys and values. Keys are ALWAYS string. Value can be anything.
6. Undefined - We create a variable, but we don't define it (we don't give ANY value).
7. Null - There is a datatype, but data is nothing.
8. Symbol - These allow uniqueness and immutability.

**In JS, array is an Object.**

## Assingment:
- Create an array and calculate the sum of that array and console it.
- Create another array and console the largest number from that array.
